This is the main repository for the _Humanities Commons_ website, [https://hcommons.org](https://hcommons.org).

It is a multisite, multinetwork Wordpress instance based on [Commons in a Box](http://commonsinabox.org/).

## Statement of Purpose
_Humanities Commons_ is a network on which scholars across the humanities can create a professional profile, discuss common interests with colleagues, develop new publications, and share their work with other scholars and with the world. _Humanities Commons_ serves both individual scholars and the professional organizations to which they may belong. _Humanities Commons_ is a trusted, not-for-profit network with a primary focus on the needs of scholars and others working in humanities fields: the network is open to any interested participant, it is managed by scholarly societies, and it provides the metrics and preservation strategies that scholars today expect and require.
